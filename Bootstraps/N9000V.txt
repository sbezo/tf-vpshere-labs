# template preparation:

# When N9300V OVA run first time, it is necessary to connect via console, but web nor network console didn't work. (Network serial because of license)
# solution - serial console via pipe to VM windows machine !!!
 \\.\pipe\namedpipe
 Nexus(server) -> VM(client)

# first time it wass necessary to boot manualy from loader
loader > boot nxos64-cs.10.5.1.F.bin

# basic common setup for Nexus, All VMs from this template will inherit this config
conf t
boot nxos nxos64-cs.10.5.1.F.bin
interface mgmt0
 ip address dhcp
 no shut
copy runn start

# delete pipe from template - otherwise new VMs from template will want use the same pipe

# convert VM to Template

#################

# DHCP server cannot run on Cisco switch !!! - all N9300V send the same 'client-id' so they obtain the same IP
# I used DHCP on Alpine with following option, which ignore client-id sent by nexuses:
ignore client-updates;

# after Nexuses boot, you can find assigned IPs + MAC addresses:
cat /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases

################
# after booting new N9300V VMs was neccessary:
 mac-address 0094.7e3a.1b08
 no  mac-address 0094.7e3a.1b08
# on each L3 interface - probably bug...


# VM -IP pairing
esxcli network vm list
esxcli network vm port list -w <ID>
MAC address of first interface <-> dhcplease/MAC/IP
